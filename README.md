rove - I2C ADC is a 12-bit precision ADC module based on ADC121C021. It helps you increase the accuracy of value collected from analog sensor by providing a constant reference voltage. Because its address is changeable, you can use up to 9 I2C ADC at the same time at most. At the other hand, this module provides auto sleep function which lowers the power consumption considerably.
 
Features

* Low power consumption
* High precision
* Automatic power-down mode
* Address changeable

-----
**Note:**

This is a Suli-Compatible Library, You Should Download Suli for your platform, please refer to [https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Suli](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Suli "Suli")

If you can't find Suli for your platform, please contract us, If you can port it yourself and pull request to us, We'll be appreciated. 

***For Arduino:***

Just like you use the other Library, What's different is you should download Suli for Arduino First, remember that just put Suli for Arduino to your Arduino libraries folder.

***For non-Arduino Platform:***

For a non-Arduino platform, what you need is xxx.h and xxx.cpp(you can change it to xxx.c while your compiler can't support c++), the other files like xxx_Arduino.h and examples is for Arduino, you can just delete them.
